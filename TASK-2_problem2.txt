This program will allow the user to find the nth term of a fibonacci series where Nth term is F(N) 

Declare : term,previous,next,sum,i as integers
INPUT : term
DECLARE :Integer Array F[term+1]     //where term+1 is the size of array  
ASSIGN : previous=0
ASSIGN : next=1
ASSIGN : i=0
DoWhile : (i<term+1){
	ASSIGN : sum=previous+next
	ASSIGN : F[i]=previous
	ASSIGN : previous = next
	ASSIGN : next=sum
	ASSIGN : i=i+1}
OUTPUT : F[term]
